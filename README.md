# AI University Diploma - Activities

This repository contains all exercises and notebooks developed throughout the Artificial Intelligence university diploma. Each module is organized in its own directory, with Colab notebooks that cover theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and experiments.

## 📚 Modules Overview

### 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Artificial Intelligence, including the types of problems tackled by AI systems (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) and how to evaluate their performance. It sets the stage for understanding the broader AI landscape.

### 2. Machine Learning
Focuses on classical machine learning techniques for solving problems like regression, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering. Algorithms such as linear models, decision trees, and k-means are explored and applied to real-world datasets.

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Covers tools and methods for analyzing natural language using machine learning techniques. Topics include text preprocessing, vectorization, sentiment analysis, and basic NLP models for understanding and generating human language.

### 4. Neural Networks
Provides foundational skills to design and train neural networks. Includes essential deep learning concepts such as forward/backward propagation, model tuning, and architectures like CNNs and RNNs using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### 5. Artificial Intelligence-based Computer Vision
Explores image and video analysis techniques using AI. Covers image preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying deep learning models like convolutional neural networks for tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.

### 6. Emerging Technologies for AI and Machine Learning
Focuses on emerging tools and methodologies for building modern AI systems. This includes feature engineering, data processing pipelines, and the use of large language models (LLMs) to build intelligent applications.
